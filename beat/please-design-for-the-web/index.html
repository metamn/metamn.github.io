New techniques like flexbox <sup id=footnote--1><a href=#footnotes--1>1</a></sup> are a shift like moving away from tables were fifteen years ago. Not to mention browser and device capabilities changing so fast even front-end developers can hardly catch up.</p><p>Designers you need to adapt or die. With old approach you&#39;ll bloat all: budget, experience and joy.</p><h2 id=award-winning->Award winning?</h2><p>Recently I come across a new project looking promising. The product was great, the company behind was expert in the cutting edge web, there were lots of very difficult animations required, the front-end framework was free to choose.</p><p>Yummy. All set up for an award winning website. I gave a relaxed estimation for the project. I knew it will worth it.</p><h2 id=a-single-psd>A single PSD</h2><p>Bang! What I&#39;ve received from the designer was a single PSD file at 1440px width.</p><ul><li>No assets. Images were @1x landscape only. SVG icons, logo, artwork were missing. I had to ask for them separately.</li><li>Messy typography. Sometimes styles were differing by 1px or a few. There was no modular scale <sup id=footnote--2><a href=#footnotes--2>2</a></sup> and it was using 7-8 font variants initially later reduced to the necessary 5.</li><li>No horizontal rhythm. Plenty of vertical guidelines in the PSD (following some logic) but no single horizontal guide at all.</li><li>No animations. I&#39;ve received them almost hand-drawn with hints on Slack</li><li>Terrible design decisions showing the designer had no coding experience.<ul><li>Three or more layers stacked up</li><li>Elements moved partially off-screen</li><li>Multiple elements stacked in a row without meaning on small screens.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The aesthetics was good. The message was clear. Sections were well thinked and structured. I&#39;ve started the project excited.</p><h2 id=proof-of-concept>Proof of concept</h2><p>Using my own, homegrown and battle-tested framework <sup id=footnote--3><a href=#footnotes--3>3</a></sup> I&#39;ve started to build up a rough version of the site. With focus on responsiveness, usability and delivering the message <sup id=footnote--4><a href=#footnotes--4>4</a></sup>.</p><p>Every component and section I&#39;ve created was immediately responsive. By using banal breakpoints like <code>mobile</code>, <code>tablet</code>, <code>laptop</code>, <code>desktop</code>, <code>portrait</code> and <code>landscape</code>.</p><p>Every section was usable. If they were animations they fit on a single screen estate like a slide in a presentation. To make users enjoy the interaction without scrolling up and down to see the changes.</p><p>The story folded out effortlessly. Messages were easily digestible on all screens / scrolls and well separated visually without consuming too much attention from the user.</p><p>In two weeks we had a real, enjoyable view of the website on all devices. Even if we started with a single 1440px wide PSD.</p><h2 id=ooooh-instead-of-wooow>Ooooh instead of Wooow</h2><p>Epic failure at the first design review.</p><p>My partners (the designer and the project manager) did not understood the benefits I&#39;ve incorporated in the prototype. They&#39;ve only saw the PSD was not implemented &quot;as is&quot;.</p><p>Yes, it was eyeballed and made to work on all devices. Yes, some graphics with animations spanning 1.5-2 screens in the PSD were reduced to fit a single browser screen to be usable. Yes, a vertical rhythm was added on my own since it was missing from the PSD.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached an agreement. I&#39;ll restart the project by replicating exactly the PSD on an 1440px wide viewport then move to all other viewports and screen resolutions, devices. And I wont charge these changes.</p><h2 id=finally>Finally</h2><p>Measuring started. Guidelines, rulers, converting pixels to elastic measures in an Excel sheet. I&#39;ve even received a new PSD comp for the mobile menu. The 1440px version come out pixel perfect. Wooow.</p><p>But it was enjoyable only horizontally and not vertically. The whole message and experience got lost in the translation. Sections which were once in the prototype taking a single screen now were split in two screens making the user to scroll and connect screens with their attention to get the message.</p><p><code>mobile-large</code>, <code>mobile-xl</code>, <code>ipad-pro</code>, <code>fullhd</code>, <code>tablet-landscape</code>, <code>tablet-portrait</code> breakpoints were introduced still making the site not 100% responsive but working in major screen resolutions and devices.</p><p>Responsiveness was driven by the idea to fit that 1440px wide design on all screens instead of re-thinking each screen. What users want to see, in which order of importance, and how to connect the dots to deliver the message and still delight. Thus we&#39;ve forced the layout, we&#39;ve introduced Internet Explorer, Safari and Mozilla bugs and making a banal repositioning of elements to take an hour.</p><p>All I had in my mind during this process was the words of Dudley Store:</p><p>&quot;abandon previous assumptions and practices in web page layout [ ... and design]&quot;</p><h2 id=award-winning->Award winning ??!!!</h2><p>No, not yet.</p><p>This website won&#39;t even get its place in my portfolio. Nor in my memories as a pleasant entry. It took longer than planned with less revenue for me than planned and more costly for my employer than planned.</p><p>A missed opportunity for the client, a modern idea in put old clothes.</p><h2 id=web-designers-adapt-or-die>Web designers adapt or die</h2><p>It&#39;s harsh I know but I had to.</p><p>I want to get back the joy translating your visions for all the web; I want to move forward our techniques and skills with every project; I want device-perfect first then pixel-perfect next; I want to fix a bug or modify something in 10 minutes instead of hours. I want to keep the budget.</p><p>I want to provide a living styleguide for you and the client. I want to focus on accessibility and usability, on user experience. I want animations. I want micro interactions. I want pride, glory and awards.</p><p>And make everyone happy.</p></div><nav class=article__footnotes><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol class=ol><li class=li id=footnotes--1><span class=footnote><span class=footnote__link><a class=link href=http://thenewcode.com/780/A-Designers-Guide-To-Flexbox title="A Designer’s Guide To Flexbox">A Designer’s Guide To Flexbox</a></span> <span class=footnote__go-back><a class=link title="Back to the footnote" href=#footnote--1><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class=text>Back to the footnote</span></a></span></span></li></ol></nav><aside class=article__categories-and-date><h3>Article categories and date</h3><nav class=article__categories><h3 class=title>Categories</h3><span class=categories>code, design</span></nav><time class=article__date>Aug 30, 16</time></aside></article><script type=application/ld+json>{ "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "mainEntityOfPage":{ "@type":"WebPage", "@id":"http://metamn.io/beat/please-design-for-the-web" }, "headline": "Please Design For The Web", "alternativeHeadline": "And make everyone happy.", "image": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images//favicons/favicon-196x196.png", "height": 426, "width": 320 }, "author": "Csongor Bartus", "genre": "web design and development", "keywords": "code design", "url": "http://metamn.io/beat/please-design-for-the-web", "datePublished": "2016-08-30", "dateModified": "2017-09-20", "description": "And make everyone happy.", "publisher": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "Metamn", "logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "http://metamn.io/assets/images/icons/favicon-196x196.png" } } }</script><aside class=contact-artwork><h3>Contact Artwork</h3><aside class=figure-with-text-around-circle><h3>Figure with a text around in circle</h3><figure class=figure><picture class=picture><source media="(min-width: 1600px)" srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(max-width: 599px)" srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><img class=img src=http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png alt="Email icon"></picture><figcaption class="figcaption figcaption"><a class=link href=http://metamn.io/beat/contact title="• Follow • Contact">Follow / Contact</a></figcaption></figure><div class=text-around-circle><span class=text-around-circle__text><a class=link href=http://metamn.io/beat/contact title="• Follow • Contact">• Follow • Contact</a></span> <span class=text-around-circle__chars></span></div></aside></aside><footer class=footer><h3>Footer</h3><a class="link flip beat" href="http://metamn.io/beat/" title=Beat><span class=flip__span data-hover=Beat>Beat</span></a> by <a class="link flip metamn" href=http://metamn.io title=METAMN><span class=flip__span data-hover=METAMN>METAMN</span></a></footer><script src=http://metamn.io/beat/assets/scripts/site.footer.min.js></script></body></html>
