For their clarity, comfort and assurance. Finally, we are on the right path.</p><p>However, we might not be immediately capable to embrace it. They require change of mind and change in company culture.</p><h2 id=what-design-systems-are>What Design Systems Are</h2><p>It&#39;s 2019 yet many articles with such titles are popping up and get voted up constantly. Even silly or basic ones. People &mdash; it seems &mdash; are still familiarizing with the idea.</p><p>I find this strange.</p><p>Google&#39;s Material Design is many years old; so it is Lonely Planet&#39;s Rizzo. React offers design system and living styleguide plugins and implementations. Sketch has a plugin to export a design system into React components without code written. Even this blog was created using a design system four years ago.</p><p>Why design systems are not ubiquitous?</p><p>The answer was not obvious until I&#39;ve met a company willing to implement it but failed on the road.</p><ul><li><strong>Development team</strong>: Yes, we can see now how a Design System can constitute the basis for all our other assets (websites);</li><li><strong>Design team</strong>: Yes, we&#39;ve been designing with design systems since 2007, and we see the commercial capacity.</li></ul><p>In spite of the enthusiasm and good will we&#39;ve ended up with no design system at all.</p><h2 id=what-difficulties-design-systems-impose>What difficulties Design Systems impose</h2><p>In this particular case &mdash; which might be similar as well for other companies this size and cultural heritage &mdash; the design team was not able to deliver a design system.</p><p>On code, we&#39;ve ended up with components so big in number and redundancy they&#39;ve escaped under control.</p><p>On designer &larr;&rarr; developer communication the pattern was the classic one: developer, execute the creation!</p><p>And the lessons were grim.</p><h2 id=deconstruction>Deconstruction</h2><p>A design system is not a continuously expanding thing like the comps of the past were. It is canonical, deconstructed to the minimum number of parts. It asks the question <em>How we can re-use?</em> instead of throwing a <em>Let&#39;s quickly add ...</em>.</p><p>There are no hacks &mdash; anymore, unfortunately &mdash; instead there is contemplation. If an element in a design system is singular, not reused elsewhere it can&#39;t be part of the system.</p><p>With design systems the design is reduced to its fittest form. A result not always trivial to achieve.</p><h2 id=systems-thinking>Systems thinking</h2><p>Artists are not engineers.</p><p>Some minds are not capable of systems thinking. A person with excellent aesthetic skills can&#39;t be expected to oversee hundreds of <em>mechanical</em> parts of a user interface from links and link states to responsive and re-usable page structures &mdash; from atoms to molecules and organisms.</p><p>Artists need help.</p><p>With design systems there is tight control over creation. Every flaw during design is revealed during code. And flaws can&#39;t be forced to be implemented, like in the old comp-days when the designer had an ultimate authority over the developer.</p><h2 id=code-components>Code components</h2><p>Design systems require to be implemented with code components.</p><p>A relatively new paradigm, again, components eliminate the chance of hacking. No dev can jump in and change quickly a button&#39;s color or reduce the size of an image.</p><p>First the system has to be understood. Then changes applied reckoning they affect an entire system instead of being a quick local patch &mdash; as in the old times.</p><p>Control is bi-directional. As devs reveal design flaws during their work, accordingly, their work is validated continuously by the design system.</p><h2 id=real-teamwork>Real teamwork</h2><p>Design systems are more math than art.</p><p>They are a combination of creativity and engineering skills. It&#39;s a teamwork where both parties &mdash; designers and developers &mdash; are equal and decisions are made on best practices, consensus, rather than hierarchy.</p><h2 id=tldr->TLDR;</h2><p>Creating user interfaces and experiences is getting more interesting and satisfactory with these new changes in technology and methodology.</p><p>The learning curve can be sometimes steep <sup id=footnote--1><a href=#footnotes--1>1</a></sup>. Both for the designer, the developer, and for the management. New skills, new kind of decision-making are required.</p><p>Like responsive design ten years ago &mdash; design systems are revolutionary.</p></div><nav class=article__footnotes><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol class=ol><li class=li id=footnotes--1><span class=footnote><span class=footnote__link><a class=link href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/" title="My struggle to learn React">My struggle to learn React</a></span> <span class=footnote__go-back><a class=link title="Back to the footnote" href=#footnote--1><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class=text>Back to the footnote</span></a></span></span></li></ol></nav><aside class=article__categories-and-date><h3>Article categories and date</h3><nav class=article__categories><h3 class=title>Categories</h3><span class=categories>design, trend</span></nav><time class=article__date>Apr 27, 19</time></aside></article><script type=application/ld+json>{ "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "mainEntityOfPage":{ "@type":"WebPage", "@id":"http://metamn.io/beat/design-systems-are-a-cultural-challenge" }, "headline": "Design systems are a cultural challenge", "alternativeHeadline": "Design systems are more math than art", "author": "Csongor Bartus", "genre": "web design and development", "keywords": "design trend", "url": "http://metamn.io/beat/design-systems-are-a-cultural-challenge", "datePublished": "2019-04-27", "dateModified": "2021-04-10", "description": "Design systems are more math than art", "publisher": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "Metamn", "logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "http://metamn.io/assets/images/icons/favicon-196x196.png" } } }</script><aside class=contact-artwork><h3>Contact Artwork</h3><aside class=figure-with-text-around-circle><h3>Figure with a text around in circle</h3><figure class=figure><picture class=picture><source media="(min-width: 1600px)" data-srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1024px)" data-srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" data-srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><source media="(max-width: 599px)" data-srcset="http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png, http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile2x.png 2x"><img class="img lazy" data-src=http://metamn.io/beat/assets/images/email_mobile.png alt="Email icon"></picture><figcaption class="figcaption figcaption"><a class=link href=http://metamn.io/beat/contact title="• Follow • Contact">Follow / Contact</a></figcaption></figure><div class=text-around-circle><span class=text-around-circle__text><a class=link href=http://metamn.io/beat/contact title="• Follow • Contact">• Follow • Contact</a></span> <span class=text-around-circle__chars></span></div></aside></aside><footer class=footer><h3>Footer</h3><a class="link flip beat" href="http://metamn.io/beat/" title=Beat><span class=flip__span data-hover=Beat>Beat</span></a> by <a class="link flip metamn" href=http://metamn.io title=METAMN><span class=flip__span data-hover=METAMN>METAMN</span></a></footer><script src=http://metamn.io/beat/assets/scripts/site.footer.min.js></script></body></html>
