  <h1 id="title">An Approach To Web Design</h1>

  <p>
    This is a case study to present an effective approach to web design using industry best practices.
  </p>


  <h2 id="#ch1">TLDR;</h2>

    <li><a href="#ch2">Fit to screen</a></li>

  </ol>

  <h2 id="ch1">1. Design around the message</h2>

  <p>
    Every website sells something. A book, a blog post, a subscription, a photo &mdash; an information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step is to identify <span>what the website sells,</span> how this item feels, and how people buying them will feel about.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff">Smuff</a> sells physical products. Represented by photos, short and long descriptions and price.
    We are in the business of <em>selling photos</em> &mdash; first of all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smuff products are high-tech, bleeding edge, unique, never seen before toys and useful gifts. Which make visitors <em>feel special,</em> lucky to have the opportunity to find them.
  </p>
  <p>
    For sure when they decide to buy they'll <em>feel happy</em> &mdash; finally a good, outstanding, stylish gift is found and can be given to anybody with guaranteed success and satisfaction. 
  </p>

  <p class="separator"></p>

  <p>
    Guess what will the main design element be? Driving the entire site design? And what message will transmit?
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  <h3>The Smuff Product Thumb</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Does it looks interesting, special?</li>
    <li>Does it make you happy?</li>
    <li>Is it techy / geeky / cool?</li>
  </ol>

  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs-1.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>

    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs-2.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I hope identifying and designing the most important element of the page is done. 
    And people will find it <span>cool, powerful and happy.</span>
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>After the product thumb the main menu was created, then the logo.</li>
    <li>This made us clear the design elements we will re-use will be &mdash; borders &mdash; from menu and &mdash; backgrounds &mdash; from product thumb.</li>
    <li>In plus, striped background won't be reused ever. Being so strong will serve only the main design element, the product thumb.</li>
  </ul>




  <h2 id="ch2">2. Fit to screen</h2>
  <p>
    One major problem on desktop monitors is scrolling. More precisely sometimes you have to scroll to see the page as an ensemble.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design should fit the screen. Long pages should be divided visually into smaller sections. Each section, and on scrolling new sections must also fit the screen. 
  </p>

    The second section.
  </figcaption>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    Every section looks like a standalone page. Visitors can easily overview and understand the message. Then move to the next <em>slide</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've done the same approach. Even the checkout page was fit into a single desktop window.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>

  <h2 id="ch3">3. Focus points</h2>
  <p>
    Jakob Nielsen, one of the most important usability experts 
    narrows down perfectly in <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/">Design Guidelines for Homepage Usability</a>:
    
    <q>
      Visitors can focus only on 5 things on a single page.
    </q>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Focus point</th>
        <th>Function</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Identity</td>
        <td>Makes the visitor feeling safe, being in the right place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Offer</td>
        <td>What this page offers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Values</td>
        <td>Emphasize what your site does that's valuable from the user's point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Action</th>
        <td>Emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point for what to do next.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Entertainment</td>
        <td>If all above are not interesting for the user make it feel good by offering something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  
  <p>
    Implementing these usability rules is hard at first. You should compact visually all focus points. Many times their parts are scattered around the screen.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've fully implemented these principles on the most important page &mdash; the product page &mdash; which takes around 70% of total traffic.
  </p>
  
  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro/2012/12/12/pebble-smartstick-energie-pentru-smartphone-uri" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/focus-points.png" alt="Smuff product page"></a>
  </figure>

  <p>
    What overlaps here and couldn't be further separated are the <em>Identity</em> and <em>Values</em> sections.</p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Identity contains the logo, the strapline, and the Facebook like counter.
    <br/>
    And also the main product categories which differentiate Smuff from competition.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By design categories are in the same structure like <em>Values</em>. They overlap in a way making the message more powerful. 
  </p>

  <h2 id="ch4">4. Reuse</h2>
  <p>
    What makes design strong and perfect is uniformity: a few design elements used and reused all over again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fonts, headings, links, colors, navigation, lists, backgrounds, separators, forms, images &mdash; we have already <em>ten</em> elements all mandatory parts of a website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use a couple of font families, you have to have at least three headings, you need at least a couple of colors, you have more than one navigation block, and multiple backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    From ten basic design elements you are already over twenty or thirty at least.
  </p>
  <p>
    People can focus on five content blocks at once &mdash; this might be true also for design elements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Good design stays out of the visitors' way.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is almost invisible &mdash; just assuring the perfect <em>flow</em> for a visitor to become customer.
  </p>
  <p>
    It must seduce. Design should make an imprint in people's mind. To get them back.
  </p>
  <p>
    If not, your entire business model is doomed. You'll have to buy visitors to your site, and buy them back again.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've managed to make 44% of customers coming back. And we've got feedback about the perfect shopping experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The one-click checkout page was unseen before. And the design is so simple people are focusing only on product images &mdash; which was the original goal.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Smuff is far not perfect. It has many design flaws, unfinished touches, non-uniform solutions.</li>
    <li>We know that, and we know also <span>design is a never ending story, it is an iterative process.</span></li>
    <li>
      We've stopped &mdash; temporarily &mdash; when we've reached our goal: to be the best gift shop in Romania.
      <a href="https://www.google.ro/#sclient=psy-ab&q=magazin+cadouri+site:ro&oq=magazin+cadouri+site:ro&gs_l=hp.3...4590.8592.1.8920.10.9.1.0.0.0.300.2185.2-8j1.9.0....0...1c.1.19.psy-ab.DOX1fOkOpfY&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.48705608,d.Yms&fp=e73e0d65504a0269&biw=1920&bih=1110">Check it out yourself.</a>
    </li>
    <li>On mature markets this design would be medium, or maybe banal. But first of all design should follow business objectives not just aesthetics.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <h2 id="ch5">5. Industry standards</h2>
  <p>
    Web design is not standardised and won't ever be. It will stay free, a playground for creatives.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Standardised is typography, color matching, and web development.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    Being an ancient art typography reached certain level of standards during centuries.
    Today no one skips the typographic grid, font pairings and the vertical rhythm.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Grid</h4>
  <p>
    There are <a href="http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#grid-tools">plenty</a> grid systems ready to use.
    However I prefer to roll my own grid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why? Because is easy to create a responsive grid, has less bloat than frameworks imply, offers more control, and persists the principle of separation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My HTML code has as less <em><...  .class></em> and <em><...  #id></em> as possible. I only use them when absolutely necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to employ <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3003-css-taking-control-of-the-cascade">37Signal's approach</a> to code front-end by separating HTML, CSS and Javascript. This way structure and content stays fully themeable, adaptable to changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In plus rolling your own grid lets you play with niceties like the <em>golden ratio</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Fonts and Copy</h4>
  <p>
    I use them as a major design weapon. I believe text lasts forever in contrast to images and colors which are subject of trend changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Copy is more important than design. The role of design elements is to navigate you to the message. The work is done by the text itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a fan of the <span>modern style</span>. 
  </p>
  <ul>  
    <li>Headings don't stand out by size but by decoration.</li>
    <li>Everything is aligned to left.</li>
    <li>Non-linear text blocks are separated by white space.</li>
    <li>Asymmetry and rhythm drives the flow.</li>
    <li>Magazine-like design versus newspaper style.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <figcaption>
    An example of modern web copy.
  </figcaption>
  
  
  
  
  <h4>Rhythm</h4>
  <p>
    When dealing with long text like blog posts you should ensure the reader won't get tired reading.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where the vertical rhythm steps in. Tommi Kaikonnen and Iain Lamb managed to teach me best how this works.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to check out their interactive tutorials: 
    <a href="http://kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/section/1">Interactive Guide to Blog Typography</a> and
    <a href="http://lamb.cc/typograph/">Scale & Rhythm</a>.
  </p>
  
  
  
  <h3>Colors</h3>
  <p>
    Color theory is ancient too. Harmony is a must and can be easily touched via various helpful tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases I roll on my own color palette inspired by the world around: nature, city landscapes and objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other cases I use two beautiful tools like Adobe's Kuler and Color Scheme Generator.
  </p>

  </figcaption>
  
  
  
  <h3>Web development</h3>
  <p>
    The code displaying your site design must be understandable by all devices, browsers and bots. This is where standards come in. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are standard requirements for every web page. Valid HTML, mobile compatibility, analytics, semantics, usability, search engine optimisation, security, social media and more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also the tools and processes creating the code for web pages have been standardised. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content is separated from presentation and business logic &mdash; Model-View-Controller.</li>
    <li>Design code is not declarative but programmable &mdash; SASS and other CSS frameworks.</li>
    <li>Everything is measured and optimised for performance.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The most complete list of standards and best practices I've found on 
    <a href="http://webdevchecklist.com/" title="Web Developer Checklist">Web Developer Checklist</a>. 
    However I've never met a budget allowing the implementation of all these <em>must have</em> features.
  </p>
  <figure class="bordered">

  </figcaption>
  
  
  <h2 id="ch6">6. Summary</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Drive design by the message.</li>
    <li>Always fit content to the screen.</li>
    <li>Save your visitors attention.</li> 
    <li>Keep your design fit by reuse.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    And if you want to create something really standing out ask for a proper budget before.
