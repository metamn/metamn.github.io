  <h1>An Approach To Web Design</h1>

  <p>
    This is a case study to present an effective approach to web design using industry best practices.
  </p>


  <h2 id="#ch1">TLDR;</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="#ch1">Design around the message</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch2">One screen at once</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch3">Five elements on a screen</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch4">Uniform design elements</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch5">Industry standards</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="ch1">1. Design around the message</h2>

  <p>
    Every website sells something. A book, a blog post, a subscription, a photo &mdash; an information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step is to identify <span>what the website sells,</span> how this item feels, and how people buying them will feel about.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff">Smuff</a> sells physical products. Represented by photos, short and long descriptions and price.
    So we are in the business of <em>selling photos,</em> first of all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smuff products are high-tech, bleeding edge, unique, never seen before toys and useful gifts. Which make visitors <em>feel special,</em> lucky to have the opportunity to meet, see and know them.
  </p>
  <p>
    For sure when they decide to buy they'll <em>feel happy</em> &mdash; finally a good, outstanding, stylish gift is found and can be given to anybody with guaranteed success and satisfaction. 
  </p>

  <p class="separator"></p>

  <p>
    So what's the main design element driving the entire site and what message displays?
  </p>

  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro/cadouri/cadouri-traznite" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>
  </figure>
  <figcaption>
    Smuff product thumbs
  </figcaption>

  <ol>
    <li>Is it something special?</li>
    <li>Does it make you happy?</li>
    <li>Is something techy / geeky going on here?</li>
  </ol>

  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs-2.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>
  </figure>
  <figcaption>
    And now?
  </figcaption>

  <p class="separator"></p>

  <p>
    I hope identifying and designing the most important element of the page is done. 
    And people will find it <span>cool, powerful and happy.</span>
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When designing Smuff the first element done was the product thumb, then the main menu, then the logo.</li>
    <li>This made us clear the design elements we will re-use will be borders and backgrounds.</li>
    <li>And this striped background won't be reused ever. It is so strong it will serve only the main design element, the product thumb.</li>
  </ul>
