  <h1>An Approach To Web Design</h1>

  <p>
    This is a case study to present an effective approach to web design using industry best practices.
  </p>

    <li><a href="#ch2">Fit to screen</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch3">Focus points</a></li>

  </ol>

  <h2 id="ch1">1. Design around the message</h2>

  <p>
    Every website sells something. A book, a blog post, a subscription, a photo &mdash; an information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step is to identify <span>what the website sells,</span> how this item feels, and how people buying them will feel about.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff">Smuff</a> sells physical products. Represented by photos, short and long descriptions and price.
    We are in the business of <em>selling photos</em> &mdash; first of all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smuff products are high-tech, bleeding edge, unique, never seen before toys and useful gifts. Which make visitors <em>feel special,</em> lucky to have the opportunity to find them.
  </p>
  <p>
    For sure when they decide to buy they'll <em>feel happy</em> &mdash; finally a good, outstanding, stylish gift is found and can be given to anybody with guaranteed success and satisfaction. 
  </p>

  <p class="separator"></p>

  <p>
    Guess what will the main design element be? Driving the entire site design? And what message will transmit?
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  <h3>The Smuff Product Thumb</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Does it looks interetsing, special?</li>
    <li>Does it make you happy?</li>
    <li>Is it techy / geeky / cool?</li>
  </ol>

  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs-1.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>

    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/smuff-product-thumbs-2.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I hope identifying and designing the most important element of the page is done. 
    And people will find it <span>cool, powerful and happy.</span>
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>After the product thumb the main menu was created, then the logo.</li>
    <li>This made us clear the design elements we will re-use will be &mdash; borders &mdash; from menu and &mdash; backgrounds &mdash; from product thumb.</li>
    <li>In plus, striped background won't be reused ever. Being so strong will serve only the main design element, the product thumb.</li>
  </ul>




  <h2 id="ch2">2. Fit to screen</h2>
  <p>
    One major problem on desktop monitors is scrolling. More precisely sometimes you have to scroll to see the page as an ansamble.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design should fit the screen. Long pages should be divided visually into smaller sections. Each section, and on scrolling new sections must also fit the screen. 
  </p>

    The second section.
  </figcaption>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    Every section looks like a standalone page. Visitors can easily overview and understand the message. Then move to the next <em>slide</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've done the same approach. Even the checkout page was fit into a single desktop window.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are on a <em>normal</em> desktop screen (1366x768px) and around you've probably noticed the design follows this principle described above.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  
  
  <h2 id="ch3">3. Focus points</h2>
  <p>
    Jakob Nielsen, one of the most important usability experts 
    narrows down perfectly in <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/">Design Guidelines for Homepage Usability</a>:
    
    <q>
      Visitors can focus only on 5 things on a single page.
    </q>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Focus point</th>
        <th>Function</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Identity</td>
        <td>Makes the visitor feeling safe, being in the right place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Offer</td>
        <td>What this page offers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Values</td>
        <td>Emphasize what your site does that's valuable from the user's point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Action</th>
        <td>Emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point for what to do next.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Entertainment</td>
        <td>If all above are not interesting for the user make it feel good by offering something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  
  <p>
    Implementing these usability rules is hard at first, then they become <em>de-facto workflow</em> for every good designer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hard part is to compact visually focus points. Many times they are scattered around the screen.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've fully implemented these principles on the most important page &mdash; the product page &mdash; which takes around 70% of total traffic.
  </p>
  
  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro/2012/12/12/pebble-smartstick-energie-pentru-smartphone-uri" alt="Smuff" title="Smuff"><img src="/assets/focus-points.png" alt="Smuff product page"></a>
  </figure>

  </figcaption>
  
  <p>
    What overlaps here and couldn't be further separated are the <em>Identity</em> and <em>Values.</em></p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Identity contains the logo, the strapline, and the facebook like counter.
    <br/>
    And also the main product categories which differentiate Smuff from competition.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By design categories are in the same structure like <em>Values</em>. They overlap in a way making the <em>Message</em> more powerful. 
  </p>

  <h2 id="ch4">4. Uniform design</h2>
  <p>
    What makes design strong and perfect is uniformity: a few design elements used and reused all over again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fonts, headings, links, colors, navigation, lists, backgrounds, separators, forms, images &mdash; we have already <em>ten</em> elements all mandatory parts of a website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use a couple of font familes, you have to have at least three headings, you need at least a couple of colors, you have more navigation blocks, and backgrounds to highlight something important.
  </p>
  <p>
    From ten basic design elements you are already over twenty or thirty, at least.
  </p>
  <p>
    And as we saw earlier people can focus on five things at once &mdash; which is true also for design elements.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    Good design stays out of the visitors' way.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is almost invisible &mdash; just assuring the perfect <em>flow</em> for a visitor to become customer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meantime it must seduce, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic function of design beside selling is to make an imprint in people's mind. And get them back.
  </p>
  <p>
    If not, your entire business model is doomed. You'll have to buy visitors to your site, and buy them back again.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    At Smuff we've managed to make 44% of customers coming back. And we've got feedback about the perfect shopping experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The one-click checkout page was unseen before. And the design is so simple people are focusing only on product images &mdash; which was the original goal.
  </p>
  
  <p class="separator"></p>
  
  <p>
    To have a good design the designer must know your niche.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every business is unique. Even if they share the same market and customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their message and approach, style must be different. And this is where the design comes in and makes a definitive impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Buying templates, using general design frameworks like Bootstrap, outsourcing to Pakistan &mdash; are temporary solutions, just to start you up.
    <br/>
    If you want to make it design should be the foremost investment in your business.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Smuff is far not perfect. It has many design flaws, unfinished touches, non-uniform solutions.</li>
    <li>We know that, and we know also <span>design is a neverending story, it is an iterative process.</span></li>
    <li>
      We've stopped (temporarily) when we've reached our goal: to be the best gift shop in Romania.

    </li>
    <li>In U.S. or other developed markets Smuff would be banal, or medium. But design should follow business objectives first of all, not just aesthetics.</li>
  </ul>
