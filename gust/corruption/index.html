We are all destroyers. As a specie we are done unless we stop destroying.</p><p class=separator></p><p>Internet by nature is the perfect anti-corruption tool.</p><p>It started to regulate / napster the corrupt industries and now goes after all remaining incumbent power structures.</p><p>The last 10 years gave us the freedom to listen to any kind of music, to watch any movies we want, to read about whatever we want, to learn better than in universities and to do business in an affordable way.</p><p>Who were made happy by internet? We, the usual suspects. Simple guys being constrained in the past by the rules imposed over our lives by others.</p><p>It seems internet is getting us rid of corruption. It helps single individuals and small communities to flourish and is punishing any organized form of greed and vanity.</p><p>Maybe we are not corrupt by nature but our institutions all around us. We grew up in corruption whether we wanted or not.</p><p class=separator></p><p>Once all corrupt institutions will be transformed we will have the freedom to rebuild our lives — this time — from bottom up.</p><p>The overall quest is for control, for the Control of Culture. Up until now it was dictated from above.</p><p>Will we have that clairvoyance to control ourselves? Does our level of intelligence will permit such an utopia? Would large masses live up to be free or they will do better under obscure control?</p><p>Digital Natives — 4chan, Anonymous — are meant to fight and win this war. The next generation will read from ether and will have encoded in their genes this goodwill we emit with all our senses today.</p></aside></article><nav class=prevnext><h3>Articles navigation</h3><a class="link link-with-arrow-triangle" href=/beauty title=Beauty><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--left"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--left arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span></a> <a class="link link-with-arrow-triangle" href=/images-are-programs title="Images Are Programs"><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--right"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--right arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span></a></nav><section class=meta><h3>Article meta</h3><time class=meta__date>March 27, 2011</time><aside class=meta__categories><h3>Article categories</h3><div class=categories><span class=categories__icon>#</span> <span class=categories__list><a class=link href=/about/values title=values>values</a> <a class=link href=/about/napstering title=napstering>napstering</a> <a class=link href=/about/institutions title=institutions>institutions</a></span></div></aside></section><nav class=articles><h3>Articles</h3><div class=trigger><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class=trigger__text>Archive</span></div><ul class=ul></ul></nav><nav class=tags><h3>Tags</h3><div class=trigger><span class="arrow-with-triangle arrow-with-triangle--top"><span class=arrow-with-triangle__line></span> <span class="triangle triangle--top arrow-with-triangle__triangle"></span></span> <span class=trigger__text>Tags</span></div><ul class=ul></ul></nav></div><footer class=footer><h3>Footer</h3><nav class=logo><h3>Logo</h3><a class="link flip pulse" href="/" title=Gust><span class=flip__span data-hover=Gust>Gust</span></a></nav>by<nav class=logo><h3>Logo</h3><a class="link flip metamn" href=http://metamn.io title=Metamn><span class=flip__span data-hover=Metamn>Metamn</span></a></nav></footer><script src=/assets/scripts/site.footer.min.js></script></body></html>
