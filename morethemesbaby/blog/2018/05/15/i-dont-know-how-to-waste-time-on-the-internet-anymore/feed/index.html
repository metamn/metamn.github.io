		<description><![CDATA[Today my internet consumption habit (on all channels like apps + sites) is reduced to 10-15 minutes long sessions for 2-3 times a day. Nothing more. This is all professional news reading, inspiration, and learning. For the fun I go out into the real life with real people.

Ten years ago I had an experiment by creating my own &#039;personal news agency&#039;. It was a Wordpress blog / lifestreamer aggregating all what I&#039;ve consumed that day. In plus I had written weekly summaries and monthly predictions in 3-4 major categories like business, technology, lifestyle etc.

What&#039;s left from that experiment is almost nothing. The domain is gone, the database is gone. But I&#039;ve learnt that never do predictions just sense the horizon, and, consuming so much news damages your brain, destroys your attention, and spends energies on things which are not really related to you. 

I see the current mood like this: the bubble will burst, the heureka moment of apps, networks, sharing etc will be gone, people will get off the net, and come back forced by AR, VR, and IoT. The web will stay as a pure, dry, professional tool.]]></description>
