		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just moved to the Duck Duck Go browser on all my devices. I&#039;ve wiped Chrome entirely, and kept Safari (cannot be wiped on iPad) and Firefox out of sight. Right now I have one visible browser app which is Duck. 

On laptop I started to use Duck as the default search engine in Firefox since Duck has no browser app for desktop / Ubuntu.

Let&#039;s see what happens. I&#039;ve tried to switch to Duck many times before but I needed to switch back to Google since I couldn&#039;t find anything ... ie. the search was not working fine at that times.]]></description>
