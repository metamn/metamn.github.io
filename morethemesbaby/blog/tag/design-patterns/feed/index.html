				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It turns out Javascript, like <a href="http://metamn.io/morethemesbaby/blog/2018/03/05/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP</a> on it&#8217;s own, is again a not so good language, it&#8217;s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17079952">just a good language, actually</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1007"></span></p>
<p>I agree. I have a BSc in Computer Science and I have experience with programming languages like Assembly, C, C++, Pascal, Delphi, bash, PHP, Ruby, and Javascript. The most I&#8217;ve liked was ― in order of importance ― Assembly, Pascal, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, bash, C, C++.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself a world class programmer and I do not write sophisticated code just back-end code like business logic for websites and web applications mostly using PHP and Javascript, earlier Ruby. I don&#8217;t really like programming because of the difficulties these languages present for me as a developer.</p>
<p>PHP was so ugly ten years ago I had to switch to Ruby. That was a big relief and I really enjoyed writing Ruby code. With the decline of the language and its web ecosystem I had to switch back to Javascript and PHP, and today I find myself again not enjoying programming.</p>
<p>I think the web is completely broken if these are the two most used languages to program it.</p>
<p>And I also think programming is broken since the code I write is always the same. I never have to invent anything interesting just write boilerplate code and sometimes add a few new, original algorithms. I don&#8217;t have to use design patterns, I don&#8217;t have reusable code components in the way I have reusable user interface components (design systems). My programming skills are in decline when my design skills are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>I think programming is a huge waste. Why the next messaging app needs billions of investment again? Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, etc. all share the same codebase in a way, yet their codebase are written from scratch every time for huge sums of money, instead of being reused. I have the impression programming got institutionalized which means its first and foremost task is to sustain itself, the programmers, who do the same tasks all over again in different companies.</p>
<p>We have design systems ― like Google Material Design ― which work for many designers and front-end developers. They are free and reusable. We might need something like this for business logic / back-end programming tasks. I would be happy with that instead of rewriting the same code for every new project and wasting time.</p>
<p>I miss the creativity from programming as I experience it every day in design.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/brainjunk-and-the-killing-of-the-internet-mind/?ncid=rss">Techcrunch got fed up</a> with the <a href="http://metamn.io/gust/attention-based-economy/">attention economy</a>. They call it brainjunk, and they call our senseless everyday news consumption to an end.</p>
<p>I agree. In addition I call current (deceptive, dark pattern-ish, attention consuming) web design practices to an end. They are polluting in the same way our brains as the news overflow does.</p>
<p>This is HFD—Human Friendly Design—where everything is forbidden. Only three things are allowed to be visible on a webpage: identity, message, action. That&#8217;s all. That&#8217;s what is absolutely necessary.</p>
