<p>I think we developers are lucky these days of being able to observe what is coming in world politics / world order from what is going on today in our area of expertise.</p>
<p>For example, lately US elections were won by using each time a <em>novel</em> technique from IT. Obama won by <em>mobilising</em> via social networks, Trump won by <em>abusing</em> social networks. Consequently the Obama era in tech was about the mobile, the Trump era in tech is about privacy / security and their abuse.</p>
<p>Tech drives our life and our entire specie.</p>
<p>I remember one year ago I was talking with friends ― one lawyer, one artist ― about what is going on in tech and I&#8217;ve said we see a total fragmentation.</p>
<p>In the previous era you&#8217;ve needed a <em>few</em> strong technologies to build a site ― a concept (REST), a framework (Ruby on Rails), a database (MongoDB) and a host (Heroku) ― now we build sites using <em>tens of thousands</em> of Node / Javascript / API-based components and microservices coming from, and deployed to different hosts (CDNs, repositories, web-,  application-, integration-, test-servers, etc.).</p>
<p>This fragmentation introduces a new level of chaos. If <em>one</em> of the thousands building components is compromised or hijacked the whole result can be altered.</p>
<p>Or, as Stanislaw Lem explained, in the age of chaos impossible things happen on regular basis. He said, take the 100 best shooters and increase the distance of the targets with a few meters; none of them will shoot a target. Now take 1000 random people, give them the guns, make them shoot, and a target will be shoot.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s read again Pat Helland&#8217;s <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3226077">Consistently Eventual</a> article in ACM Queue, and try to put in non-IT but global context the gems like:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t really know what happened until you&#8217;ve heard everything.</p></blockquote>
