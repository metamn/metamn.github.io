				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is challenging to talk about a single truth at a single place or time.<span id="more-1065"></span></p>
<p>I think we developers are lucky these days of being able to observe what is coming in world politics / world order from what is going on today in our area of expertise.</p>
<p>For example, lately US elections were won by using each time a <em>novel</em> technique from IT. Obama won by <em>mobilising</em> via social networks, Trump won by <em>abusing</em> social networks. Consequently the Obama era in tech was about the mobile, the Trump era in tech is about privacy / security and their abuse.</p>
<p>Tech drives our life and our entire specie.</p>
<p>I remember one year ago I was talking with friends ― one lawyer, one artist ― about what is going on in tech and I&#8217;ve said we see a total fragmentation.</p>
<p>In the previous era you&#8217;ve needed a <em>few</em> strong technologies to build a site ― a concept (REST), a framework (Ruby on Rails), a database (MongoDB) and a host (Heroku) ― now we build sites using <em>tens of thousands</em> of Node / Javascript / API-based components and microservices coming from, and deployed to different hosts (CDNs, repositories, web-,  application-, integration-, test-servers, etc.).</p>
<p>This fragmentation introduces a new level of chaos. If <em>one</em> of the thousands building components is compromised or hijacked the whole result can be altered.</p>
<p>Or, as Stanislaw Lem explained, in the age of chaos impossible things happen on regular basis. He said, take the 100 best shooters and increase the distance of the targets with a few meters; none of them will shoot a target. Now take 1000 random people, give them the guns, make them shoot, and a target will be shoot.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s read again Pat Helland&#8217;s <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3226077">Consistently Eventual</a> article in ACM Queue, and try to put in non-IT but global context the gems like:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t really know what happened until you&#8217;ve heard everything.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve stumbled upon a very interesting article on Slashdot about a writer learning to code: <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/features/code-to-joy">Code to joy</a></p>
<p>It fits perfectly to my series of articles about how <a href="https://morethemes.baby/blog/2018/05/19/javascript-another-fractal-of-bad-design/">coding is broken</a>. But this article is more about discovering the joy in coding, those heureka moments we all experience when learning to code.</p>
<p>Also, this article slaps epic objective quotes to us, programmers, quotes defining the art of programming, things we don&#8217;t see anymore, by being sunk in minor technical details in the everyday job we perform almost blindly.</p>
