<p>Creating knowledge is a hard problem. I have 6 months of data on this blog, around 200 posts, but still unable to figure out what knowledge <em>lies</em> in here.</p>
<p>So the strategy is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue adding posts, and see how knowledge can be distilled.</li>
<li>Create a <em>new</em> Pro version of the Log Lolla theme focusing on presentation instead of knowledge.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately even tech news are giving me anxiety.<span id="more-1048"></span></p>
<p>After a decade of consuming news / information from all channels every single day, throughout the whole day, gradually I&#8217;ve managed to spend around half an hour a day on the internet. This includes everything like social media, professional news, and local / world news.</p>
<p>The result of this process is this blog. Partially, because this blog is focusing only on professional news. On social media I have nothing to say, or consume, I use it for messaging only. On personal development / world and local news I write a post a week elsewhere.</p>
<p>What struck me lately is how tech got institutionalised. Local news are about corruption; world news are about wars and conflicts; tech news are about abuse ― how Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook &amp; co are exploiting us.</p>
<p>Tech is <a href="https://morethemes.baby/blog/2018/05/15/i-dont-know-how-to-waste-time-on-the-internet-anymore/">not fun</a> anymore. Tech is not exciting anymore. Tech doesn&#8217;t gives back pleasure anymore. Tech is hostile as the world around brought by the news.</p>
<p>Ten years ago I found the real life more boring than the digital universe. Now I find true the exact opposite. No problem. All my works ― like this blog ― will stay optimistic. I&#8217;ll filter out everything and trying to bring back the joy in tech.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I&#8217;ve started to work on the Pro version of the Log Lolla theme often times I find myself thinking about that this theme is somehow <em>meta</em>. In the sense of dealing exclusively with the extraction of meta-information from the blog posts to form knowledge.</p>
<p><span id="more-899"></span></p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve outlined the features of the <em>Archives</em> page which will bring some new exciting things like:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be able to act as the homepage / frontpage of the site</li>
<li>It should not look like a blog, instead more like a magazine, following the brutalist style</li>
<li>Archives will present meta information about the blog, an upper view of what is going on under the hood</li>
<li>The UI / UX must be playful revealing lots of new, unexpected facets about the underlying information</li>
<li>There should be a set of visualisation components like galleries, sliders, lists etc. — which can be freely associated to categories, tags, post formats and post types — enabling some king of customisation / personalisation. The idea is that instead of letting users change colors and fonts the user should be able to assembly the meta view of her blog / content / knowledge. Maybe many sites running the Log Lolla Pro theme will have the same aesthetics but a very different display of knowledge.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress.org has a clear set of rules for theme developers regarding what should go into a theme, and how. These are all constraints. Mandatory and necessary guidelines to make sure all WordPress.org themes offer more-or-less the same functionality for the end user. And that functionality is plain blogging nothing else. This makes WordPress less appealing for users―if they want a portfolio, a small business website, or anything special.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are other theme stores like ThemeForest with less constraints. Here one can find themes packed with extra functionality satisfying―literally―all kind of needs. This is what makes WordPress the most popular web platform of all times. By removing constraints these themes boost diversity and often times lower the quality.</p>
<p>Log Lolla was meant to be a WordPress.org theme to support a certain level of quality. Log Lolla Pro will build on that by adding new features which in turn follow WordPress.org standards. Combine quality with openness.</p>
<p>What Log Lolla Pro needs to do is to move from a plain blogging platform―imagined and designed more than 10 years ago―to a more modern tool to create knowledge from the everyday (online) activities of a person or small group.</p>
<p>When WordPress was created there were barely any social networks. Now it seems―after a spectacular rise―social networks are in decline due to their greedy and inhuman nature. People are migrating off the networks and they need a new tool where they can post their stuff like they have did before, but maybe with a better context, with better return of their investment. A WordPress and Log Lolla Pro combo?</p>
<p>This is the aim of the pro version of the Log Lolla theme: help people to post like on a social network, and, help people to get an insight about their own story. Let&#8217;s give back the meta information to the user, let&#8217;s give them tools to see their data from multiple angles, and let&#8217;s give them tools which makes them to grow, to be happy, and proud.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this since 2013 and it works. All my knowledge―both technical and about the world―went into three self-made blogs, each with a special purpose.</p>
<p><a href="http://metamn.io/pulse/">Pulse</a> is a high level technical overview of what goes around in the web design and development world + the internet sector in general. It collects links and creates a review for every year in form of keywords identifying major trends.</p>
<figure id="attachment_827" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-827" src="https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-08.50.57-768x1024.png" alt="The Pulse screenshot" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-08.50.57-768x1024.png 768w, https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-08.50.57-225x300.png 225w, https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-08.50.57.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Pulse screenshot</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://metamn.io/beat/">Beat</a> is more deep in the sense of being about original posts and ideas instead of links.</p>
<p>While Pulse gives knowledge about yearly meta-trends in form of buzzwords Beat creates knowledge which can be used every day. It has series of posts like <em>What to learn next</em>, <em>Masters of web</em>, and <em>Web trends</em> which collects web design and development best practices and inspiration in a form easily translatable into working code.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m starting a new project I always come here for inspiration; when I&#8217;m finishing a project I&#8217;m always updating this blog with findings; Beat is like the groove of a musician―your own knowledge and style for work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_828" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-828" src="https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-09.01.07-768x1024.png" alt="The Beat screenshot" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-09.01.07-768x1024.png 768w, https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-09.01.07-225x300.png 225w, https://morethemes.baby/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-09.01.07.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Beat screenshot</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://metamn.io/gust/">Gust</a> is another story, it is about a worldview instead of a work-view. It collects ideas and thoughts through ages about the control of culture―a lifelong hobby.</p>
<p>As Pulse and Beat, Gust is about knowledge but in another way: the audience is not the author but you. Anybody reading through this blog has to have the same understanding as the author has. And in plus it has to provide all source information to readers to let them re-check the facts, let them render their own view and knowledge from the same set of source.</p>

<p>Log Lolla Pro will merge all these three knowledge creation tools into a whole, and, using the Indie Web, it will be social in the sense of enabling collaboration and reach.</p>

<p><a href="https://morethemes.baby/blog/tag/indie-web/">IndieWeb</a> is a set of tools to help you to remove your dependency from social networks. It does not eliminate the social networks but it makes you to be in control. All your content from all networks, and all reactions to your content from anywhere goes to your own blog instead of being scattered across networks, which we know, come and go.</p>
<p>IndieWeb is not yet ready for the prime time and requires a set of plugins to be added to WordPress to make it work; however the feature set it provides is worth a try for <a href="https://morethemes.baby/themes/log-lolla/">Log Lolla</a> &#8212; a theme meant for bringing back the joy of blogging, and, to create knowledge from you everyday news consumption and learning activity.</p>
<p>Today the IndieWeb is used, developed, and advocated only by a small number of tech enthusiasts and never hit the mainstream. I think <acronym>More Themes Baby</acronym> should help to make it more popular, and spread it to new generations.</p>
